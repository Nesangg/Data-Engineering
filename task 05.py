#Calc Area of a Triangle
#I am getting very confused with what is required, the exercise ask's for area, the person who reviewed 
# wanted the semiperimeter so i changed it, then the next reviewer wants area again so now i've changed it 
# back to calc the area.

def triangle(x,y,z):
   area=(x+y+z)/2
   return area
